const deletedProduct = await Product.findOneAndDelete({ id: id });

// Added proper ID generation
const newId = existingProducts.length > 0 ? Math.max(...existingProducts.map(p => p.id)) + 1 : 1;

// Added price field support
price: newProduct.price || 0,
```

### Frontend Architecture
- Centralized state management in App.jsx
